            This is a cycling/fitness game I worked on as a developer while employed at Improvement Interactive. It is an online multiplayer game, with the ability to bike and exercise with people from all over the world. It has a variety of maps to ride on, as well as realistic cycling physics.

            This is a game that I recently published on the Google Play Store. It a hyper-casual game with a simple play style. You launch a black hole to move around the screen, collecting items, some of which will increase your score and some will decrease. There is a minimum number of total points needed to pass each level. This game has two different play modes, with 250 levels each.

            This was the first game that I spent a large amount of time working on. It was intended to by an adventure and exploration game with a very unique world. Though it was not completed, I believe the procedural meshes I created are worth showcasing here.

            This is the project I've spent the most time on so far. It is a 3D steampunk physics-based mechanical building game. Objects can be attached to each other to create variety of things, including buildings and moving vehicles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are just a few details of how some of the game elements work:
            Axles are connected to other objects via physics joints. Gears have a capsule collider in each tooth which is optomized for operating with other gears. Engines provide torque to attached axles.
            Objects are attached to each other with a per-object grid system, meaning they are attached to the grid of the connected object instead of the world grid. This allows systems of connected objects to move freely in world space as long as they are not connected to the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game has two modes: a creative mode with an unlimited number of building components to build whatever you want, and a puzzle mode in which you are given a limited number of components to build a solution to a specific task.
          </p>
          <p>
            This video clip shows a solution to one of the puzzle levels.

            Another code-based audio visualization that I created. The music used is "Red Line" by Anna Yvette. Some objects, like the sun rays and the mountains, move according to the music volume, while the ribbons in the sky move according to which mid-range frequency band is currently the loudest.

        <h2>Cube World Tanks</h2>

          <p>
            This is a game for mobile devices. Tanks move around a cube shaped world, and the player attempts to use their tanks to destroy the enemy tanks. It is a combination puzzle/battle game. Currently there is only one level and more details are needed, but the concept seems to work quite well.

            Drag your finger across the playing field to rotate around the world. Buttons are displayed on the screen for the other controls.
