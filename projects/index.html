      <h2>Simple Serenity</h2>
      <p>I composed this haiku thinking about things that I enjoy and bring me peace of mind:</p>
      <div id="haiku">
        <em>A walk amidst green<br>
        By a lovely flowing stream<br>
        Peace pure and simple</em>

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8 col-md-offset-2">
          <p>
          Firstly, I love nature&mdash;trees, mountains, rivers, etc. I want to live somewhere that's very green with lots of 
          trees and some sort of body of water bordering my property or at least nearby. I also love hiking and exploring 
          in the mountains. It's always really cool to discover a small cave or some other interesting landmark while 
          doing so. Honestly, I don't spend as much time out in nature as I would like, though last semester I managed to 
          go hiking almost every week due to a goal that I set for my health class. I would like to continue hiking often. 
          I enjoy rock climbing as well, which is another thing I would like to do more often.</p>
          <p>
          I love fantasy and science fiction. The more creative the world, universe, or concept the better. The book 
          <em>Storm Thief</em> by Chris Wooding is a good example of this. It takes place on a post-apocalyptic 
          city-covered plateau island which is beset by storms that can alter anything they touch, doing anything from 
          simply rearranging things to creating unusual monsters and many other things. When I was in elementary school I 
          used to read a lot, but unfortunately that lessened as I got older. In the last couple years, however, I've been 
          listening to audiobooks as I can do so while driving or working. I've gone through <em>The Wheel of Time</em> and 
          <em>The Stormlight Archive</em> series that way, as well as a few other books. I love being able to get my fill 
          of the stories from these books without needing to take much extra time to do so. Movies can be really great for 
          their stories as well. Some of the movies that I love include <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, the Miyazaki/Studio 
          Ghibli films, <em>Star Wars</em>, etc.</p>
          <p>
          Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I'd like to talk about some of my creative endeavors. I've always had a 
          drive to create new things that are interesting, exciting, and different from anything else. When I was I was 
          younger I loved creating my ideas with Legos, and I also really enjoyed taking things apart and building them 
          into something new. I've always been pretty good with computers and I use that as a creative medium as well. I 
          enjoy using programming to bring some of my ideas to life. I also enjoy 3d modeling. I've spent a good amount of 
          my free time this year teaching myself how to use the Unity game engine and create my own games. I've also 
          played around some with video editing recently. My plan for the future is to first get a job programming after 
          school and then, provided I can get the traction I need, to eventually be entirely self-employed creating games
          and possibly YouTube videos.</p>
